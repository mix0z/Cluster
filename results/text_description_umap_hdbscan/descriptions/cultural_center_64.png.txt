This architectural plan features three main functional blue volumes arranged in an angular layout, forming an "L" shape. Horizontal connections (gold lines) effectively link these main spaces, providing seamless access throughout the structure. Supporting functions (pink volumes) are strategically positioned adjacent to the main volumes, ensuring accessibility without disrupting primary circulation. Vertical connections (red elements) are placed centrally, facilitating efficient movement between different levels. Overall, the spatial organization encourages fluid circulation, promoting connectivity between main and supporting elements.
