This is a multi-volume building with a complex topology. The main functional spaces (blue volumes) are distributed in a linear sequence, with some connectivity and separation between them. Horizontal connections (gold lines) interlace throughout the structure, linking the main spaces while also providing access to vertical connections (red) like stairs or elevators. Supporting functions (pink volumes) are strategically positioned at various intersections, aiding in space utility and navigation. The overall spatial organization is intricate, facilitating dynamic circulation while maintaining clear demarcation of functional areas.
