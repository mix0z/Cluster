This architectural plan features a central blue volume composed of interconnected main functional spaces. These are linked by a series of gold horizontal connections that run across and between the spaces, ensuring smooth access throughout the structure. The pink supporting functions are positioned around the perimeter and between main volumes, providing supplementary facilities without interrupting primary circulation. Red vertical connections are strategically placed at pivotal access points, facilitating efficient movement between different levels. The design emphasizes a central network of circulation paths, integrating both main and supporting areas seamlessly.
