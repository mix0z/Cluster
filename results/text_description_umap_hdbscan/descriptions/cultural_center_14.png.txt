The architectural plan consists of a central blue volume representing the main functional space, flanked by supporting pink volumes. Gold lines indicate horizontal connections that weave around the main and supporting spaces, providing seamless circulation. Red elements, strategically located, serve as vertical connections, ensuring accessibility across levels. The supporting functions are distributed adjacent to the main space, enhancing support and convenience. The overall spatial organization promotes a fluid circulation path, integrating functions effectively and maintaining navigational clarity.
