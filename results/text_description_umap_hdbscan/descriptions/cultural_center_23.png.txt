The architectural plan presents a single large main volume (blue), centrally positioned, with a rounded form, which serves as the focal point of the layout. Horizontal connections (gold) wrap around the main volume's upper side, linking it to other spaces. Supporting functions (pink) are distributed at the periphery, with a significant segment aligned along the left corridor, enhancing spatial integration. Vertical connections (red) are strategically placed at key junctions, ensuring seamless vertical movement alongside the horizontal flow. Overall, the layout is organized around the central main volume, promoting efficient circulation and accessibility throughout the building.
