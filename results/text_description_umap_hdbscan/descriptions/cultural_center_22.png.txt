This architectural plan features multiple blue volumes representing main functional spaces, dispersed throughout the design. Horizontal connections, indicated by gold lines, weave through these main volumes, creating a network of accessible pathways. The pink supporting function volumes are strategically positioned adjacent to the main spaces, providing essential services and accessibility. Vertical connections, marked by red elements, are placed at various points within the plan, facilitating efficient movement between levels. The overall spatial organization and circulation are complex yet coherent, ensuring seamless integration of functions and ease of navigation.
