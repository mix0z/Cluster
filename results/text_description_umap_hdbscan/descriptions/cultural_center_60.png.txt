This architectural plan consists of several main functional spaces (blue volumes) arranged in a clustered layout. Horizontal connections (gold lines) traverse these volumes, linking them effectively and providing access to various parts of the structure. Supporting functions (pink volumes) are strategically positioned adjacent to both horizontal and vertical connections, facilitating their supplementary role. Vertical connections (red elements) are distributed throughout the plan, ensuring accessibility between different levels. The overall spatial organization emphasizes connectivity, with a clear circulation path achieved through the integration of corridors and strategically placed supporting spaces.
