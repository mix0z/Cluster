This architectural plan consists of a central blue volume representing the main functional space with a distinctive branching topology. The horizontal connection (gold line) bridges two supporting function volumes (pink) within the central area, facilitating transition and accessibility. A red element indicates vertical circulation, strategically positioned between the supporting functions, suggesting a core access point. The supporting volumes are embedded within the main space, highlighting their integrative role in the overall function. The spatial organization emphasizes connectivity and centrality, promoting efficient circulation and interaction among different areas.
