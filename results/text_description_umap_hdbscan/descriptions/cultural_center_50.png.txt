The architectural plan features multiple blue volumes arranged in a horseshoe pattern, with the central space left open. Horizontal connections, represented by gold lines, form a continuous loop around these main volumes, integrating access throughout the building. Supporting functions, in pink, are distributed along the perimeter and intermittently within the main volumes, suggesting secondary services or amenities augmenting the primary spaces. Red vertical connections are strategically placed at intervals, ensuring efficient movement between levels. This arrangement creates a cohesive spatial organization, optimizing circulation and accessibility while maintaining a clear definition between primary and secondary areas.
