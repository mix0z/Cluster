This architectural plan features multiple main volumes (blue) irregularly distributed, creating a dynamic layout. Horizontal connections (gold) link these spaces, forming a cohesive circulation network that interconnects different zones effectively. Supporting functions (pink) are strategically placed adjacent to main volumes, offering auxiliary services without obstructing flow. Vertical connections (red), scattered throughout, provide access to different levels, ensuring smooth vertical movement. The spatial organization promotes easy navigation, with a clear distinction between primary and supporting areas, enhancing user experience and functionality.
