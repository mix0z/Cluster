This architectural plan features multiple main volumes (blue) symmetrically arranged on either side of a central axis. Horizontal connections (gold) intersect centrally, forming a cross, and efficiently link the main volumes while providing direct access to multiple supporting functions (pink), strategically positioned near these corridors. Vertical connections (red) are centrally located, ensuring convenient vertical movement between levels. The overall spatial organization encourages smooth circulation, with a balanced integration of functional and supporting spaces to enhance accessibility and usability.
