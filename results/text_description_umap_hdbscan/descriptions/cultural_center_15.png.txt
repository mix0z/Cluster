This architectural plan features multiple blue volumes arranged around a central space, creating a cohesive arrangement of main functional areas. Gold horizontal connections form a loop around the central volume and extend outward, linking all main and supporting spaces (pink) while also integrating several red vertical connections strategically located at the peripheries. Supporting functions, in pink, are dispersed around the main volumes, often adjacent to horizontal pathways, providing easy access and complementing the primary spaces. The overall spatial organization emphasizes an efficient circulation system, with the central loop allowing smooth navigation between different parts of the building.
