This architectural plan features a large blue volume as the primary space, occupying one side of the building, with smaller blue sections scattered around. Gold lines, serving as corridors, weave through the design, connecting the main spaces with the supporting functions, which are located mainly at the top and left. Red vertical connections, including stairs and elevators, are strategically placed at intersections of these corridors to facilitate movement between levels. The supporting functions (pink) are mixed into the layout, providing necessary auxiliary spaces adjacent to the primary areas. Overall, the plan demonstrates an integrated spatial organization, with clear circulation paths linking diverse functions efficiently.
