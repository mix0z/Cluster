This architectural plan features three main volumes (blue), arranged in a linear configuration with a central volume flanked by two others. Horizontal connections (gold lines) strategically weave through and connect these main spaces, forming a continuous flow path. Supporting functions (pink volumes) are distributed mainly along these horizontal paths and around the perimeter of the main volumes, allowing for convenient access. Vertical connections (red elements) are positioned at key junctions, ensuring efficient vertical circulation. Overall, the spatial organization promotes seamless movement, with the supporting functions anchoring the main volumes and enhancing the usability of the horizontal connections.
