This architectural plan features a single prominent blue volume representing the main functional space on one side, juxtaposed with supporting pink volumes at opposite ends of the configuration. A gold horizontal connection runs through the center, linking the main and supporting spaces seamlessly. Red vertical connections are strategically placed at different sections, allowing efficient vertical circulation. Overall, the spatial organization is linear and well-integrated, facilitating clear movement paths and interconnections between varied functions.
