This architectural plan consists of three main blue volumes, each functioning as a separate block. Horizontal connections, represented by gold lines, run through each volume, linking them with embedded supporting functions (pink volumes). Red vertical elements are strategically placed at the ends of the volumes, providing vertical circulation between levels. Supporting functions are distributed along the horizontal connections, ensuring easy access from the main spaces while maintaining distinct zones. The overall spatial organization is modular and interconnected, facilitating smooth circulation and integration of functions across the plan.
