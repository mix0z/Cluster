This architectural plan features a triangular arrangement of main functional spaces (blue volumes) oriented along the axes of the triangle. Horizontal connections (gold lines) run parallel to these spaces, ensuring seamless integration and access throughout the structure. Supporting functions (pink volumes) are strategically placed at key intersections of the horizontal connections, facilitating auxiliary services and interactions. Vertical connections (red elements) are positioned near the apex of the triangle, efficiently connecting different levels. The overall design promotes a dynamic and fluid circulation pattern, utilizing the geometry to optimize spatial relationships and movement.
