This architectural plan features multiple blue volumes, representing main functional spaces, arranged to form a cluster with connections along their outer edges. The gold horizontal connections link these spaces, facilitating movement between them efficiently with one long corridor running centrally and branching out. Pink volumes, indicating supporting functions, are strategically placed adjacent to these horizontal links, providing easy access and enhancing functionality. Vertical connections (red elements) are positioned at key nodes within the horizontal corridors, ensuring smooth vertical circulation. Overall, the spatial organization promotes a cohesive flow, integrating main and supporting spaces seamlessly with clear and direct circulation paths.
