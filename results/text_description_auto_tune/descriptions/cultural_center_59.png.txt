This architectural plan features multiple main volumes (blue) scattered throughout the layout, each distinct in shape and size. Horizontal connections (gold lines) weave between these volumes, creating an interconnected pathway that ensures seamless movement across different areas. Supporting functions (pink) are strategically placed adjacent to both main and connecting spaces, providing easy access without disrupting the overall flow. Vertical connections (red) are positioned centrally within major volumes, facilitating efficient vertical movement. The spatial organization is complex yet cohesive, with circulation designed to integrate functional spaces harmoniously.
