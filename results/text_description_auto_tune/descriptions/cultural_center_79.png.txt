This architectural plan features multiple blue volumes representing main functional spaces, arranged vertically and horizontally along the plan. The gold horizontal connections thread around these main spaces, acting as corridors that link the entire layout. Pink volumes, indicating supporting functions, are interspersed among the main spaces, often adjacent to or intersecting with the horizontal connections. Red vertical connection elements, such as stairs and elevators, are strategically placed at various intervals, ensuring accessible transitions between different floors or sections. The overall spatial organization emphasizes fluid movement and accessibility, with a balanced integration of main and supporting areas to optimize circulation.
