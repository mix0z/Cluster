This plan features two distinct blue volumes representing the main functional spaces. A gold horizontal connection runs adjacent to these main volumes, facilitating movement and linking them effectively. Several pink supporting functions are interspersed around the blue volumes, with a concentration near vertical connections (red), ensuring convenient access. Vertical connections are strategically placed at multiple points, enabling seamless movement between levels. The spatial organization prioritizes connectivity, offering clear circulation paths that integrate the various functions cohesively.
