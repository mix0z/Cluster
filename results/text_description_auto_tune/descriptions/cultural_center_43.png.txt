This architectural plan features three main blue volumes arranged in a linear configuration. Horizontal connections are defined by gold lines that run parallel to these volumes, creating an efficient thoroughfare. Supporting functions (pink) are strategically positioned between main volumes, providing accessible auxiliary services. Two red elements, located at opposite ends, serve as vertical connections, facilitating movement between levels. The overall layout promotes straightforward circulation, with supporting functions and connections centrally integrating into the spatial organization.
