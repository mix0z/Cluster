This architectural plan consists of two main blue volumes positioned at opposite ends of an elongated layout. A gold horizontal connection runs centrally, facilitating circulation between these main volumes. Supporting functions, represented in pink, are distributed along the horizontal pathway, ensuring easy access to the main spaces. Red vertical connections are strategically placed at key intersections, enhancing accessibility across different levels. The spatial organization promotes efficient movement and interaction between functional areas, with a balanced arrangement of spaces ensuring fluid circulation throughout the layout.
