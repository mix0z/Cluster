This architectural plan features a layout with three main blue volumes arranged linearly, signifying the primary functional spaces. The horizontal connections, represented by gold lines, link these main volumes on one side, facilitating movement and interaction. Supporting functions in pink are strategically positioned adjacent to the main volumes, providing ancillary services without interrupting the primary flow. Vertical connections, marked in red, are placed at key points to enable vertical movement, optimizing accessibility. This layout presents a balanced and efficient spatial organization, promoting clear and logical circulation throughout the building.
