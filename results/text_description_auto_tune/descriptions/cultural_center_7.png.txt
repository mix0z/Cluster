This architectural plan features multiple main volumes (blue) arranged horizontally across two levels. Horizontal connections (gold) envelope these main spaces, facilitating seamless movement across the building and ensuring access to each functional area. Supporting functions (pink) are strategically positioned adjacent to key circulation paths, providing essential services while remaining easily accessible. Vertical connections (red) are distributed at strategic locations, promoting vertical circulation and connecting the different levels efficiently. The overall spatial organization emphasizes interconnectedness and streamlined accessibility, enabling efficient user movement throughout the structure.
