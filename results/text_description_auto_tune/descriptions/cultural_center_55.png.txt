This architectural plan features multiple main volumes (blue), arranged along the outer edges of the layout, creating a spacious and distributed topology. Horizontal connections (gold) centralize circulation by linking these main volumes and moving around a circular core. Supporting functions (pink) are positioned adjacent to these corridors, primarily at the top and right sides, ensuring easy access without obstructing flow. Vertical connections (red) are strategically placed at key points around the plan to facilitate movement between levels. The overall spatial organization is fluid and well-integrated, promoting efficient circulation and accessibility.
