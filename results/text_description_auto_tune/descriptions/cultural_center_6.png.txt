This architectural plan features a single dominant blue volume at the center, representing the main functional space. A surrounding gold line forms a continuous horizontal connection that facilitates movement and links various areas, including the main and supporting functions. Pink volumes are strategically located adjacent to the main space, with one positioned at the bottom corner to enhance service accessibility. Red vertical connections are positioned at opposite corners, indicating convenient access points to different levels. The design emphasizes efficient circulation with clear distinctions between main and supporting areas, maintaining an organized and navigable space.
