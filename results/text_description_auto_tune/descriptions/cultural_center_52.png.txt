This architectural plan features two main blue volumes, each serving as a primary functional space. The horizontal connections, represented by gold lines, facilitate movement between these main volumes and the surrounding areas, creating a clear circulation path. Supporting functions, shown in pink, are strategically placed adjacent to the main spaces and along corridors, integrating seamlessly into the overall layout. Red elements mark the vertical connections, which are positioned to provide easy access between different levels of the building. The organization prioritizes efficient flow and accessibility, with well-defined pathways connecting all functional areas.
