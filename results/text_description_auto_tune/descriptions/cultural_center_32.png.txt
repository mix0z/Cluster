This architectural plan features two main volumes (blue) positioned at opposite corners of the layout. Horizontal connections (gold lines) create a loop, efficiently linking these main spaces and allowing for seamless movement throughout the area. Supporting functions (pink) are strategically placed adjacent to both the horizontal and vertical connections, ensuring accessibility and enhancing functionality. Vertical connections (red) are interspersed throughout the plan, facilitating multi-level flow and integration. Overall, the spatial organization promotes dynamic circulation while maintaining a balance between function and support.
