This architectural plan features two main volumes (blue), one atop the other, connected by vertical elements (red) indicating stairs or elevators. Horizontal connections (gold) run alongside these volumes, ensuring accessibility between different areas. Supporting functions (pink) are strategically placed adjacent to the vertical connections, facilitating easy access for users. The layout prioritizes efficient circulation, with supporting functions integrated to enhance movement across spaces. The overall design is structured yet fluid, emphasizing connectivity and usability.
