This architectural plan consists of multiple blue volumes representing the main functional spaces, arranged linearly on either side of a central corridor. The gold lines create a continuous horizontal connection, effectively linking these main spaces. Pink volumes, indicating supporting functions, are interspersed along the corridor, providing easy access to essential services. Red elements, representing vertical connections, are strategically located at the ends of the corridor, facilitating vertical circulation. Overall, the layout supports efficient movement and interaction between spaces while ensuring clear organization and accessibility.
