This architectural plan features a smoothly curved topology with multiple main volumes (blue) connected in an S-shaped form. The horizontal connections (gold lines) facilitate movement along the outer edges and interior of this curve, linking different sections effectively. Supporting functions (pink volumes) are strategically positioned along these connectors, providing accessible auxiliary spaces without disrupting the main flow. Vertical connections (red elements) are interspersed throughout, ensuring easy access between levels at key points. The overall spatial organization emphasizes fluid circulation and intuitive navigation across functional zones.
