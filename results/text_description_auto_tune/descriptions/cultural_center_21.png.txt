This architectural plan comprises three main functional volumes (blue) arranged linearly along the top of the layout. Horizontal connections (gold lines) weave between these volumes, creating a cohesive corridor system that facilitates efficient movement. Supporting function volumes (pink) are positioned adjacent to the main volumes, serving as peripheral enhancements to the primary spaces. Vertical connections (red elements) are strategically placed at the intersections of the horizontal connections and main volumes, ensuring easy access across different levels. The spatial organization promotes smooth circulation and accessibility throughout the building.
