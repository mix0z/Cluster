This architectural plan features three main blue volumes arranged in a distributed manner. Horizontal connections (gold lines) strategically link these spaces, with one forming an L-shaped corridor connecting two volumes, while another directly accesses isolated smaller volumes. Supporting functions (pink) are embedded within the L-shaped corridor, ensuring proximity to the main spaces and optimizing usability. Vertical connections (red) are centrally located within the primary volumes for seamless multi-level access. Overall, the planâ€™s spatial organization and circulation are well-integrated, providing efficient movement between functional zones.
