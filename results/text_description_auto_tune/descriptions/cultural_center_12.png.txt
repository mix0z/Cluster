This architectural plan comprises two main blue volumes interconnected by gold horizontal connections. The corridor network effectively links these primary spaces, creating an L-shaped circulation path that facilitates movement across the building. Pink supporting functions are strategically placed between and around the blue volumes, enhancing accessibility and serving functional roles in proximity to both main and secondary spaces. Red vertical connections are dispersed throughout, allowing for convenient access to different levels and integrating seamlessly with the horizontal circulation. Overall, the spatial organization promotes efficiency and ease of movement, with supporting functions and connections well-integrated into the flow.
