This architectural plan features a single main volume (blue) centrally located, with a circular supporting space (pink) wrapped around a portion of its perimeter. Horizontal connections (gold lines) encircle the supporting space, linking the main and supporting functions seamlessly. Vertical connections (red) are positioned on the left, providing direct access between levels. The spatial organization unifies the main and supporting functions while ensuring fluidity and ease of movement throughout the structure.
