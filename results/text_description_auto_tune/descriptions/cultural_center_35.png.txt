This architectural plan features a single, dominant main volume highlighted in blue, centrally located and flanked by various functional elements. The horizontal connection, represented in gold, extends across the plan, linking the main functional space with peripheral pink volumes dedicated to supporting functions. Vertical connections in red are strategically placed adjacent to the main volume, facilitating efficient upward and downward movement. Supporting functions are positioned along the periphery, ensuring ease of access while maintaining the core area's openness. This organization ensures clear circulation routes, with the horizontal connection seamlessly integrating different spaces and functions.
