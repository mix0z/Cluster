This architectural plan comprises several main volumes (blue) arranged in a grid-like pattern. Horizontal connections (gold lines) efficiently link these main spaces, facilitating access and circulation throughout the building. The supporting functions (pink) are interspersed among the main volumes, providing auxiliary services without disrupting the flow. Vertical connections (red) are strategically placed at key junctions, ensuring seamless transitions between different levels. The overall spatial organization is structured and cohesive, allowing for intuitive navigation and optimizing functional relationships between spaces.
