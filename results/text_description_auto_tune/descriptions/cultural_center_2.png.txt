This architectural plan features a central main volume (blue) flanked by supporting functions (pink) on one side. Horizontal connections (gold lines) create a T-shaped pathway, providing access between the main and supporting volumes. A vertical connection (red) is centrally located, emphasizing efficient vertical movement within the dominant main space. Supporting functions are positioned adjacent to the main area, enhancing accessibility while maintaining clear separation. The overall spatial organization promotes a coherent circulation pattern around the central vertical node, ensuring direct and logical movement throughout.
