This architectural plan features two main volumes (blue) arranged side by side, forming the core functional spaces. A horizontal connection (gold) is centrally placed, linking the two blue volumes and facilitating smooth circulation between them. Supporting functions (pink) are positioned at either end of the main volumes, with one additional pink section within the smaller main volume, ensuring accessibility to resources. Vertical connections (red) are situated adjacent to each supporting function, providing efficient transitions between floors. The spatial organization prioritizes clear movement pathways and integrates all elements cohesively.
