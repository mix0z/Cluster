This plan features three main functional volumes (blue), arranged in an L-shape, creating distinct zones. A single gold horizontal connection integrates these spaces, extending from one corner, wrapping around to connect all main areas while facilitating movement. Supporting functions (pink) are located strategically between and adjacent to main spaces, functioning as transition zones. A single vertical connection (red) is positioned centrally against one main volume, optimizing access across levels. The spatial organization supports a fluid circulation path, enhancing connectivity and cohesiveness in layout.
