This architectural plan features multiple blue volumes arranged along a diagonal axis, forming the main functional spaces. Gold lines run internally, connecting these spaces horizontally and ensuring seamless flow between them. Supporting functions in pink are strategically positioned adjacent to main volumes, optimizing their accessibility via the gold corridors. Red elements provide vertical connections, dispersed efficiently to enhance vertical mobility across different blue volumes. The spatial organization focuses on a dynamic yet coherent circulation, balancing accessibility and functionality throughout the layout.
