This architectural plan consists of multiple main functional volumes (blue) arranged in a radial pattern around a central core. Horizontal connections (gold) create a continuous loop, efficiently linking the main volumes and enhancing circulation around the central area. Supporting functions (pink) are interspersed strategically between the main functional spaces, allowing for easy access from both the main volumes and the corridors. Vertical connections (red) are positioned on one side of the loop, facilitating movement between different levels efficiently. Overall, the design emphasizes smooth circulation and accessibility, with a focus on integrating supporting functions seamlessly within the primary spatial layout.
