This architectural plan comprises five main blue volumes arranged in a dispersed yet interconnected layout. Horizontal connections (gold lines) create pathways between these main spaces, facilitating fluid movement throughout the building. Pink volumes are strategically positioned near corners and along corridors, serving as accessible supporting functions and enhancing utility across the layout. Red elements are evenly distributed, ensuring effective vertical circulation at various points. The plan promotes efficient spatial organization, with clear pathways linking primary zones while integrating supporting functions seamlessly.
