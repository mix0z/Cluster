This architectural plan consists of two main functional volumes (blue), positioned in line with each other, creating a linear arrangement. Horizontal connections (gold lines) run along the top and bottom, linking these spaces, providing direct access between them. Supporting functions (pink volumes) are situated within and adjacent to the main volumes, being easily accessible through the central corridor. Vertical connections (red elements) are centrally placed, facilitating vertical movement and linking different levels efficiently. The overall spatial organization emphasizes straightforward circulation, with clear separation between primary and secondary spaces.
