This architectural plan features three main volumes (blue) arranged linearly along an extended horizontal axis. Horizontal connections (gold) run through the building, linking these main spaces and facilitating easy movement. Supporting functions (pink) are strategically placed adjacent to and within the main volumes, ensuring efficient service distribution while also centralizing some key supporting spaces. Vertical connections (red) are evenly distributed, ensuring vertical accessibility throughout the structure. The overall spatial organization emphasizes a balanced flow between primary and secondary spaces, optimizing circulation and accessibility.
