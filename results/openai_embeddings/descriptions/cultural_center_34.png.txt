This architectural plan features multiple blue volumes representing main functional spaces, dispersed across the layout. Gold lines indicate that horizontal connections are strategically positioned to link these main spaces, creating a fluid circulation path throughout the structure. Pink volumes, representing supporting functions, are interspersed among the main volumes, often adjacent to red vertical connections like stairs or elevators, enhancing accessibility. The spatial organization is complex but efficient, with a clear delineation between main and supporting areas, enabling seamless interaction and movement between different sections of the building. Overall, the design achieves a balanced integration of spaces, facilitating clear navigational paths and functionally diverse areas.
