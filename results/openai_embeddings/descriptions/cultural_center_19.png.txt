This architectural plan features three distinct blue volumes representing the main functional spaces, arranged in an L-shaped configuration. Gold lines provide horizontal connections linking these spaces, forming a continuous path that runs between and around the volumes. Interspersed within and adjacent to this path are several pink volumes for supporting functions, strategically placed at key junctures, including one notably central to the main horizontal circulation. Red elements indicate vertical connections, positioned towards the edges, facilitating movement across levels. Overall, the layout integrates main and supporting functions efficiently, promoting seamless circulation and accessibility.
