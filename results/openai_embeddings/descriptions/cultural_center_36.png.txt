The architectural plan consists of two main functional volumes (blue), which are interlocked, establishing a dominant structure. Horizontal connections (gold lines) wrap around these main volumes, linking different spaces seamlessly. Supporting functions (pink volumes) are strategically positioned at the perimeter and between the main volumes, facilitating secondary access and services. Vertical connections (red elements) punctuate the design, ensuring efficient movement between levels. This spatial arrangement promotes a fluid circulation, effectively integrating primary and supporting spaces within a cohesive architectural framework.
