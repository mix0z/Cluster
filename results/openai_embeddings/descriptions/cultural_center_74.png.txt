This architectural plan consists of three main blue volumes arranged around a central core. The horizontal connections (gold lines) encircle the central space, providing seamless access between all main functional areas. Supporting functions (pink volumes) are interspersed along these corridors, strategically positioned to serve the surrounding main spaces. Vertical connections (red elements) are consistently located, ensuring vertical movement is intuitive and balanced throughout the structure. Overall, the layout facilitates efficient circulation, with a coherent flow linking primary spaces while integrating supporting functions effectively.
