This architectural plan features multiple interconnected volumes with a complex topology. The main functional spaces (blue volumes) are distributed across the diagram, linked by gold horizontal connections that form a network of corridors. Supporting functions (pink volumes) are scattered throughout, positioned adjacent to main spaces and within the circulation paths to facilitate access. Vertical connections (red elements) are strategically placed at key junctions, ensuring vertical mobility across the plan. The spatial organization promotes fluid circulation, with the interplay of horizontal and vertical pathways creating a dynamic environment.
