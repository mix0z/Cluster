This architectural plan features multiple blue volumes representing the main functional spaces, arranged in a sprawling, interconnected layout. Gold lines serve as horizontal connections, weaving through the main volumes and providing thorough access across the structure. Pink volumes, indicating supporting functions, are dispersed strategically along these corridors, ensuring convenient access to essential services. Red elements denote vertical connections, placed primarily at strategic junctions where horizontal paths converge. The overall organization supports efficient movement, with a balanced distribution between main and supporting functions, creating an integrated and navigable space.
