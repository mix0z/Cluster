This architectural plan features multiple main functional spaces (blue volumes) arranged in a staggered configuration. Horizontal connections (gold lines) traverse the plan, intersecting with the vertical connections (red elements) to facilitate access across the levels efficiently. Supporting functions (pink volumes) are strategically placed, flanking the main volumes and creating a comprehensive network of auxiliary spaces that support the primary functions. The planâ€™s spatial organization enables smooth circulation, with clear pathways that guide movement through the interconnected main and supporting spaces. Overall, the layout provides an integrated approach to spatial distribution and connectivity.
