This plan features a multi-volume configuration with three distinct main functional spaces (blue) arrayed across the layout. The horizontal connections (gold) form a network, interlinking these main spaces while abutting the supporting functions (pink), which are concentrated along one edge of the plan. Vertical connections (red) are strategically positioned at key junctions within the horizontal pathways, enhancing access and circulation. Overall, the spatial organization encourages efficient movement, with supporting functions conveniently located to serve the main volumes, and vertical elements providing essential connectivity across levels.
