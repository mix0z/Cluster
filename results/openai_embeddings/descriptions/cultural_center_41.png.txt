This architectural plan features three main functional volumes (blue), each clearly separated. Horizontal connections (gold) link these volumes, allowing for seamless movement throughout the space. Supporting functions (pink) are positioned adjacent to each blue volume, suggesting they provide essential services to the main areas. Vertical connections (red) appear strategically placed at key junctions within the horizontal pathways, integrating different levels efficiently. The overall spatial organization promotes easy circulation, with supporting functions enhancing accessibility and usability.
