This architectural plan features a dominant, singular blue volume for the main functional space, located at the top of the layout. Horizontal connections (gold lines) run along the bottom, forming an "L" shape that provides access between the main volume and supporting spaces. Supporting functions (pink volumes) are strategically placed along these gold lines, wrapping around the lower left corner of the layout. Vertical connections (red elements) are situated centrally, bridging the main and supporting spaces with the horizontal corridor. The spatial organization is efficient, with a clear delineation between functional types, ensuring smooth circulation throughout.
