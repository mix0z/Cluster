The architectural plan consists of multiple main volumes (blue) dispersed across the site, each cluster connected by gold horizontal lines that function as corridors. These connections efficiently link the separate blue volumes, ensuring cohesive access across the layout. Supporting functions (pink) are interspersed within each cluster, strategically positioned adjacent to the main spaces, facilitating easy access to these auxiliary areas. Vertical connections (red) are integrated within or near each blue block, providing essential vertical circulation. The overall spatial organization enables a fluid and logical movement pattern, with supporting functions enhancing the primary spaces without disrupting the circulation flow.
