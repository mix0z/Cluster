Cluster: Centralized Core

Description: These plans feature a centralized core space surrounded by secondary spaces. The primary area is typically large and open, with secondary spaces distributed around it, creating a hub-and-spoke layout.

Reasoning: The plans in this cluster have a dominant central space (often in blue) that acts as the focal point. Secondary spaces (in red and purple) are arranged around this core, facilitating a radial circulation pattern. This layout promotes easy access to the central area from various points.
