Cluster: Linear Sequence

Description: These plans exhibit a linear organization where spaces are arranged in a sequence along a central axis or corridor. This layout emphasizes a clear directional flow from one end to the other.

Reasoning: The linear arrangement is evident through the elongated form of the plans, with spaces aligned along a central path. This configuration supports a straightforward circulation pattern, guiding movement from one end to the other.
