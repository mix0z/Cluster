      "reasoning": "The plans in this cluster have a dominant central space (often in blue) that acts as the focal point. Secondary spaces (in red and purple) are arranged around this core, facilitating a radial circulation pattern. This layout promotes easy access to the central area from various points.",

  "analysis_process": "The analysis involved examining the spatial organization, circulation patterns, and hierarchical relationships within each plan. Key factors included the arrangement of primary and secondary spaces, the flow of movement, and the overall configuration. Plans were grouped based on shared organizational principles, focusing on fundamental spatial patterns rather than superficial similarities."
