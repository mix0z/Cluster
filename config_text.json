The main function (blue volume) is a single, dominant block, while a horizontal connection (gold) runs along its side, facilitating access to multiple supporting function volumes (pink) and vertical connections (red). The horizontal connection integrates circulation, linking different spaces efficiently. Notably, one supporting function is centrally positioned within this horizontal connection, creating a focal point in the circulation path. The overall layout is simple and direct, ensuring clear spatial organization and movement.\"",
