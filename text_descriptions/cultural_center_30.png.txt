This architectural plan consists of five main volumes (blue), distributed along a branching pattern. Horizontal connections (gold) thread through the design, creating a network that links each blue volume efficiently, ensuring seamless access. Supporting functions (pink) are strategically positioned adjacent to main spaces and along pathways, aiding accessibility without disrupting flow. Vertical connections (red) are centrally placed within key intersections, enhancing multi-level movement. The layout fosters a cohesive yet dynamic spatial organization, encouraging intuitive navigation and interaction between varied areas.
