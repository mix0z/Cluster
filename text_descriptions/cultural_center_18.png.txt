This architectural plan features multiple main functional spaces (blue volumes) distributed throughout the design. Horizontal connections (gold lines) are strategically placed to interlink these main volumes, ensuring seamless access between them. Supporting functions (pink volumes) are positioned adjacent to the blue volumes, providing necessary auxiliary services. Vertical connections (red elements) are integrated within the layout, offering efficient vertical circulation across different levels. The overall spatial organization is interconnected, promoting fluid movement and accessibility through a network of corridors and supports.
