This architectural plan comprises three main functional spaces (blue volumes) arranged in a horizontal format, forming a cohesive unit. The horizontal connections (gold lines) effectively link these spaces, ensuring smooth flow and accessibility throughout the structure. Supporting functions (pink volumes) are located adjacent to the primary path, offering convenient access and ancillary support. Vertical connections (red elements) are strategically placed at key junctions, facilitating vertical movement and integrating the overall circulation network. The spatial organization is efficiently structured, promoting intuitive navigation and functional integration across different areas.
