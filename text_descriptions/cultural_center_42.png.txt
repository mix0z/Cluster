This architectural plan features a central blue volume representing the main functional space, surrounded by smaller supporting functions (pink volumes) that are positioned towards the edges. Gold horizontal connections efficiently link these spaces, weaving through the layout to provide access across the main and supporting areas. Vertical connections (red elements) are strategically placed along the horizontal paths to facilitate easy upward or downward movement. The organization showcases a radial circulation pattern, with supporting functions enhancing the layout by providing necessary auxiliary spaces adjacent to the main volume, promoting a cohesive and well-integrated spatial experience.
