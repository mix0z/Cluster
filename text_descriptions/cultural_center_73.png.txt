This architectural plan consists of three main blue volumes arranged in an L-shape, creating a cohesive yet spacious configuration. The horizontal connections (gold lines) prominently wrap around these main volumes, effectively linking them while providing accessibility to all areas. Supporting functions (pink volumes) are strategically positioned at key points along the horizontal paths, enhancing the utility and serviceability of main spaces. Vertical connections (red elements) are positioned at the junctions of horizontal corridors, facilitating seamless vertical movement. Overall, the spatial organization is efficient, with a clear circulation path that encourages smooth transition between different zones.
