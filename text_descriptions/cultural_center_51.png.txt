This architectural plan features two main blue volumes positioned centrally, serving as the core functional areas. Horizontal connections (gold lines) wrap around these volumes, creating a continuous loop that efficiently integrates circulation throughout the building. Supporting functions (pink volumes) are distributed along the periphery and within the central area, ensuring accessibility and enhancing functionality. Vertical connections (red elements) are strategically placed at various points, facilitating easy access across different levels. Overall, the spatial organization promotes a dynamic flow, balancing centrality with a cohesive network of connections.
