This architectural plan features five main functional spaces (blue volumes) arranged vertically with some variations in width. Horizontal connections (gold lines) thread through these main volumes, linking them efficiently. Supporting functions (pink volumes) are interspersed between the main spaces and corridors, providing auxiliary services without obstructing flow. Vertical connections (red elements) are strategically placed at junctions, facilitating upward and downward movement. The overall spatial organization promotes a seamless circulation, with clear pathways and well-integrated supporting functions.
