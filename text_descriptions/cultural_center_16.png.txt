This architectural plan consists of two main blue volumes arranged in a linear fashion with a central emphasis. The horizontal connections (gold lines) effectively link these main spaces, running along the perimeter and creating a continuous flow throughout the structure. Supporting functions (pink volumes) are strategically placed adjacent to the main volumes and along the horizontal path, providing seamless access to auxiliary services. Vertical connections (red elements) are distributed at key junctions, facilitating easy transition between levels. The overall spatial organization promotes efficient circulation and a well-integrated layout, ensuring functional connectivity across the building.
