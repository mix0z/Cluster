This architectural plan features multiple blue volumes dispersed throughout the layout, each serving as main functional spaces. The gold lines, representing horizontal connections, link these main volumes, allowing movement across the spatial layout. Supporting functions, indicated by pink volumes, are interspersed near or around the main spaces, enhancing their utility. Red elements serve as vertical connections strategically placed within or adjacent to both main and supporting functions, facilitating efficient vertical movement. The overall spatial organization prioritizes effective circulation, integrating both horizontal and vertical connections to ensure seamless accessibility and interaction between different spaces.
