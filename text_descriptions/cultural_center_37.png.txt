This architectural plan features multiple main functional spaces (blue volumes) distributed across the layout, providing various distinct areas. Horizontal connections (gold lines) interlace these spaces, ensuring fluid circulation and access throughout the structure. Supporting functions (pink volumes) are interspersed primarily along the pathways, strategically positioned to augment the usability of the main volumes. Vertical connections (red elements) are strategically placed, enabling efficient movement between floors. The overall spatial organization emphasizes connectivity and accessibility, creating a cohesive, networked environment.
