This architectural plan features a series of interconnected blue volumes representing main functional spaces, primarily clustered at the center. The horizontal connections, outlined in gold, form a comprehensive network linking the main spaces and extending towards the periphery, facilitating movement and access throughout the plan. Supporting functions in pink are strategically positioned along these corridors, providing necessary services adjacent to main areas, particularly near entry points and shared walls. A red vertical connection is centrally located, acting as a crucial junction within the spatial organization. The overall design prioritizes efficient circulation, with clear pathways and strategically placed supporting functions enhancing accessibility and use of space.
