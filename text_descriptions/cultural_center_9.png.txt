This architectural plan features a multi-volume layout, with several blue volumes representing main functional spaces configured in a linear arrangement. Horizontal connections (gold lines) create a cohesive loop, linking these main spaces while establishing a clear circulation path. Supporting functions (pink volumes) are strategically placed adjacent to the main volumes, providing auxiliary services without interrupting primary activities. Vertical connections (red) are positioned at key junctions, enabling efficient access between different levels of the structure. Overall, the design maintains balanced spatial organization and smooth traffic flow, emphasizing connectivity and accessibility.
