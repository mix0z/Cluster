This architectural plan features two distinct main blue volumes, indicating the primary functional spaces, with one situated at the left and another at the right. A gold horizontal connection links these volumes, providing an efficient corridor that facilitates movement between them. Pink supporting function volumes are interspersed along the path, with key placements adjacent to the horizontal and vertical connections for accessibility. The red elements are strategically positioned at key junctions, enabling vertical circulation between different levels. Overall, the spatial organization is linear and well-integrated, promoting clarity and seamless movement throughout the structure.
