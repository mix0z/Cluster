This architectural plan consists of a single dominant blue volume representing the main functional space, segmented into smaller sections. The gold horizontal connections run across the top, linking these blue segments and facilitating access. Pink volumes, representing supporting functions, are interspersed between the blue segments, integrated within the horizontal pathway. Red elements indicating vertical connections are located centrally, ensuring easy accessibility to different levels. The overall layout promotes efficient circulation, with supporting functions strategically placed to enhance connectivity.
