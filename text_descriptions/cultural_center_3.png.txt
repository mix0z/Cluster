This architectural plan features multiple blue volumes arranged in a decentralized manner, with each volume representing distinct main functional spaces. The gold lines, serving as horizontal connections, create a branching structure that links these main spaces efficiently, allowing for seamless circulation throughout the building. Pink volumes are strategically placed adjacent to the main blue spaces, fulfilling supporting roles without obstructing movement. Red vertical connections are interspersed along the primary horizontal paths, ensuring easy access between different levels. Overall, the spatial organization is fluid and well-integrated, promoting intuitive navigation and connectivity.
