This architectural plan consists of three main blue volumes, arranged in a linear configuration. The gold horizontal connections wrap around these main spaces, providing fluid circulation paths that link them effectively. Supporting functions, in pink, are strategically placed adjacent to the corridors, offering accessibility without interrupting the main flow. Vertical connections, highlighted in red, are positioned centrally, ensuring vertical movement is efficiently integrated into the overall circulation. The spatial organization supports seamless access between functional areas, with clear pathways enhancing movement throughout the plan.
