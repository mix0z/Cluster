This architectural plan features a linear topology with three main volumes (blue) distributed along an extended axis. Horizontal connections (gold lines) flow between these volumes, linking them efficiently while fostering movement from one end of the structure to the other. Supporting functions (pink) are strategically interspersed between and adjacent to the main volumes, providing essential services without interrupting circulation. Vertical connections (red) are centered within the layout, facilitating vertical transit and acting as pivotal nodes in the circulation pattern. The overall organization is balanced and linear, ensuring clear pathways and functional integration.
