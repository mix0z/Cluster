This architectural plan features two main blue volumes positioned on opposite sides, creating a balanced layout. A gold horizontal connection bridges these volumes, forming an efficient corridor that links the two spaces. Pink volumes of supporting functions are interspersed along this horizontal path, providing necessary auxiliary services and enhancing functionality. A vertical connection, marked in red, is strategically placed near the intersection of the horizontal and one main volume, facilitating vertical movement and accessibility. The overall spatial organization promotes clear circulation, ensuring that movement between spaces is intuitive and seamless.
