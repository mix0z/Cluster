This architectural plan features a complex topology with multiple blue volumes representing main functional spaces distributed along a central axis. A prominent gold horizontal connection runs laterally, interlinking the main volumes and facilitating movement across the structure. Pink volumes, denoting supporting functions, are strategically placed adjacent to the main spaces, enhancing functionality without obstructing circulation. The red vertical connections are positioned at key junctions, ensuring efficient vertical movement throughout the building. The spatial organization promotes seamless navigation, balancing accessibility and function across interconnected zones.
