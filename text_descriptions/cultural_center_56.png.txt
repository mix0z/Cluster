This architectural plan features three distinct blue volumes representing main functional spaces, arranged with two volumes side by side and one positioned perpendicular to form an L-shape. Horizontal connections (gold) effectively link these main spaces, wrapping around the L-shape and ensuring fluid circulation. Supporting functions (pink volumes) are strategically placed at key points along these horizontal pathways, enhancing access and functionality. Vertical connections (red) are integrated within the intersection of volumes, ensuring efficient movement throughout the structure's levels. Overall, the spatial organization balances connectivity and accessibility, promoting a cohesive circulation network.
