This architectural plan features multiple blue volumes arranged around a central open space, suggesting a multi-functional building layout. Horizontal connections (gold lines) weave through the plan, linking these main functional spaces cohesively, with corridors providing a seamless flow. Supporting functions (pink volumes) are interspersed among the main spaces, strategically positioned to facilitate access without disrupting circulation. Vertical connections (red elements) are placed at strategic points, enhancing movement across different levels. The spatial organization emphasizes both connectivity and accessibility, promoting a balanced circulation that supports varied functions effectively.
