This architectural plan features two main volumes (blue) arranged adjacently, emphasizing a dual-functional area. Horizontal connections (gold lines) interweave between and around these volumes, facilitating fluid movement and access. Supporting functions (pink) are strategically placed near both the horizontal and vertical connections, optimizing utility and accessibility. Vertical connections (red) are interspersed, linking different levels and serving as key transition points. The layout ensures efficient circulation, maintaining a cohesive and navigable spatial organization.
