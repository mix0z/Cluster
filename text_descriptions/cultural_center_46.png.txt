This architectural plan consists of a curvilinear arrangement of three main functional spaces (blue) arranged concentrically around a central supporting function (pink). Horizontal connections (gold lines) interlink these spaces, allowing for fluid movement around the central pink volume. Supporting functions are strategically positioned alongside the main volumes and serve to complement and connect the main functional areas effectively. Vertical connections (red) are placed at key transition points, enhancing vertical circulation and accessibility across different levels. Overall, the spatial organization emphasizes a dynamic flow with a central focal point, promoting efficient and intuitive circulation.
