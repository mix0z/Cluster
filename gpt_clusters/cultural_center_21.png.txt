The architectural plan exhibits the following features:

1. **Number and Arrangement of Main Volumes:**
   - There are four main blue volumes.
   - They are arranged predominantly in a rectangular configuration, occupying the central and bottom areas of the plan.

2. **Horizontal Connections (Gold Lines):**
   - The gold lines extend horizontally, acting as corridors linking the blue volumes.
   - These lines create a network facilitating movement between spaces, with primary corridors connecting all blue volumes.

3. **Position and Role of Supporting Functions (Pink Volumes):**
   - The pink volumes are positioned at the top of the plan.
   - These spaces likely serve secondary roles such as offices, storage, or mechanical rooms, supporting the main areas.

4. **Overall Spatial Organization and Circulation:**
   - The spatial organization focuses on efficient horizontal flow, with corridors providing direct connections between main spaces.
   - Vertical circulation (red elements) is positioned both centrally and at key points, ensuring accessible movement between different levels.
   - The overall layout promotes functional adjacency, with supporting functions enhancing the main spaces' operations.
