1. **Number and Arrangement of Main Volumes:**
   - There is one large blue volume centrally located, serving as the primary functional space. Its size and position suggest it is the core activity area of the plan.

2. **Horizontal Connections:**
   - Gold lines are present on the left side, connecting the main blue volume to a smaller space on the left, suggesting a corridor or hallway providing access between these areas.
   - Another horizontal connection runs across the top left, linking the supporting functions with the central space.

3. **Position and Role of Supporting Functions:**
   - Pink volumes are largely on the left side, adjacent to the main volume, indicating they support the primary activities with necessary auxiliary spaces.
   - Their positioning allows functional interdependence while maintaining proximity to the main areas, likely for convenient access.

4. **Overall Spatial Organization and Circulation:**
   - The central focus is on the large blue volume, indicating a central hub.
   - Horizontal and vertical connections facilitate movement across different areas, with stairs or elevators (red elements) enabling vertical transportation.
   - The layout promotes efficient circulation, centering on the main activity space, while enabling seamless access to supportive functions and other levels.
