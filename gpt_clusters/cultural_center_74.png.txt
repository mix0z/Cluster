Based on the architectural plan diagram, here is a description focusing on its topology:

1. **Number and Arrangement of Main Volumes**:
   - There are three main functional spaces represented in blue. 
   - These spaces are arranged in a way that two of them are adjacent or connected, with the third space extending separately from the rest.

2. **Horizontal Connections**:
   - The gold lines, which indicate corridors or horizontal connections, appear to weave through the blue volumes.
   - These corridors connect all the main spaces, allowing for smooth movement between them and integrating the layout effectively.

3. **Position and Role of Supporting Functions**:
   - The supporting functions, shown in pink, are distributed around the main volumes.
   - They are strategically positioned to provide accessibility from the main functional spaces, serving necessary auxiliary roles without obstructing the primary flow.

4. **Overall Spatial Organization and Circulation**:
   - The spatial organization creates a cohesive flow, linking the main and supporting spaces through clear circulation paths.
   - The incorporation of both horizontal (gold) and vertical (red) connections indicates a multi-layered approach to circulation, including movement between floors and sections.
   - This plan facilitates efficient usage of space, with vertical connections providing essential access across different levels, integrated within the main and supporting areas.
