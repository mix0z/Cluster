Based on the architectural plan diagram:

1. **Number and Arrangement of Main Volumes:**
   - There are four main functional spaces, each colored blue.
   - These volumes are dispersed across the diagram, forming a roughly rectangular configuration with some distances from one another.
   - Two volumes are positioned near the top and bottom center, while one is on the right and another on the left.

2. **Horizontal Connections:**
   - The gold lines represent corridors that connect the different blue volumes.
   - These connections form a network that links all the main volumes, facilitating movement between them.
   - The corridors seem to create a U-shaped path linking the separate functional spaces together horizontally.

3. **Position and Role of Supporting Functions:**
   - Pink volumes, which represent supporting functions, are interspersed between the main functional spaces.
   - They are strategically placed near the horizontal connections, providing easy access to main volumes.
   - These functions likely support the main activities occurring in the blue volumes and are clustered around circulation paths.

4. **Overall Spatial Organization and Circulation:**
   - The layout promotes a clear circulation route, with horizontal paths linking main spaces and supporting functions in close proximity.
   - Vertical connections, marked in red, are positioned at intervals throughout the space, providing access to different levels.
   - The plan suggests a focus on accessibility and fluid movement, with supporting functions integrated into the circulation system to enhance operational efficiency.
