1. **Number and Arrangement of Main Volumes:**
   - The plan has two main blue volumes, positioned adjacent to each other, forming a larger functional space.

2. **Horizontal Connections:**
   - Gold lines represent corridors that effectively link the different spaces.
   - These corridors encircle and weave through the main and supporting spaces, providing fluid connectivity between areas.

3. **Position and Role of Supporting Functions:**
   - Pink volumes are strategically placed adjacent to the blue volumes, indicating that they support main activities.
   - They are placed near the edges and are interspersed within the circulation paths to provide convenient access.

4. **Overall Spatial Organization and Circulation:**
   - The spatial organization is a blend of centralized main spaces with peripheral supporting functions.
   - Circulation is efficiently laid out with corridors that facilitate easy movement between all significant areas.
   - Red vertical connections are primarily placed at converging points, ensuring access between different levels, and supporting overall fluidity in movement.
