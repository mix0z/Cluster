1. **Number and Arrangement of Main Volumes**:
   - There are three blue volumes representing the main functional spaces. They are distributed across the plan, with two smaller volumes on the left and one larger volume on the central-right side.

2. **Horizontal Connections**:
   - Gold lines represent horizontal connections, such as corridors. They link the two smaller left blue volumes to the larger central-right blue volume. This creates a cohesive transition between the main areas, facilitating movement through the spaces.

3. **Position and Role of Supporting Functions**:
   - Pink volumes, indicating supporting functions, are strategically placed adjacent to the main blue volumes. They are positioned both to the left and right of the central blue volume and to the right of the left side volumes, suggesting their role in providing auxiliary services to the main spaces.

4. **Overall Spatial Organization and Circulation**:
   - The spatial layout is linear, with the gold corridors serving as the primary connectors between functional areas. This promotes efficient circulation and access. The red element (stairs or elevators) is integrated into the central blue volume, allowing vertical movement and enhancing connectivity between different levels. The plan efficiently organizes space, ensuring functional relationships between main and supporting areas while facilitating smooth circulation.
