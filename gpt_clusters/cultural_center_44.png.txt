Here is a description of the architectural plan based on the color-coded elements:

1. **Number and Arrangement of Main Volumes**:
   - There are three primary blue volumes arranged in a linear sequence. 
   - The layout suggests these spaces are aligned along a central axis.

2. **Horizontal Connections**:
   - The gold lines (corridors) create a continuous path that links all main volumes.
   - The corridors are centrally located, providing seamless connectivity between different spaces.

3. **Position and Role of Supporting Functions**:
   - Pink volumes are interspersed among the main blue spaces, providing necessary support functions adjacent to these areas.
   - They are strategically positioned to be easily accessible from the main volumes.

4. **Overall Spatial Organization and Circulation**:
   - The spatial organization maintains a clear distinction between main and supporting functions.
   - Horizontal circulation is efficiently designed, guiding movement through the central corridors.
   - Red elements serve as vertical connections, strategically located at both ends and centrally, ensuring vertical accessibility.

Overall, the plan suggests efficient circulation and clear zoning between different functional areas, promoting both accessibility and functionality across the structure.
