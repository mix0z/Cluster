Certainly! Hereâ€™s a description of the architectural plan based on its topology:

1. **Number and Arrangement of Main Volumes:**
   - There are four blue volumes representing the main functional spaces.
   - These are distributed across the plan, with one large volume on the right, and others situated centrally and on the left.

2. **Horizontal Connections:**
   - Gold lines depict corridors connecting different spaces.
   - The largest blue volume on the right has horizontal connections extending to supporting functions and vertical elements, facilitating movement across this area.

3. **Position and Role of Supporting Functions:**
   - Supporting functions, shown in pink, are positioned adjacent to both main volumes and circulation paths.
   - They serve as auxiliary spaces, linking with main areas and facilitating transitions.

4. **Overall Spatial Organization and Circulation:**
   - The plan is organized with a clear division of main functional areas and supporting functions linked by corridors and vertical connections.
   - Circulation is efficient, with a mix of direct horizontal corridors and strategically placed vertical connections ensuring smooth flow throughout the layout. 

The plan reflects a well-structured flow, prioritizing accessibility and usability.
