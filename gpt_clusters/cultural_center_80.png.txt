1. **Number and arrangement of main volumes**:
   - There are two main blue volumes.
   - One volume is vertically elongated and curves slightly.
   - The other volume is more rectangular and positioned perpendicular to the first, creating a distinct layout.

2. **How horizontal connections link different spaces**:
   - Gold lines (corridors) run along the inner curve of the vertical blue volume, connecting it to the supporting structures.
   - Another horizontal connection extends from the first volume to link with the rectangular volume, facilitating movement between these main spaces.

3. **Position and role of supporting functions**:
   - Pink volumes are distributed near the intersections of gold lines and within the main volumes, suggesting auxiliary facilities like restrooms or storage.
   - These support the primary functions of the blue volumes, being strategically placed for ease of access.

4. **Overall spatial organization and circulation**:
   - The circulation plan is organized around the vertical blue volume, with horizontal corridors efficiently linking to both primary and supporting spaces.
   - Vertical connections (red elements) are integrated at key junctions to enhance flow between different levels.
   - The layout suggests a hierarchical spatial organization prioritizing easy navigation between distinct zones.

Overall, the design balances accessibility and function, ensuring efficient movement and connectivity throughout the structure.
