Based on the description of the architectural plan diagram:

1. **Number and Arrangement of Main Volumes:**
   - There are three distinct blue volumes. 
   - They are positioned in a somewhat triangular layout, with two on the left and one on the right.

2. **Horizontal Connections:**
   - The gold lines represent horizontal connections.
   - There are two main corridor lines, forming a T-shape, connecting all blue volumes.
   - These corridors facilitate movement across the main spaces.

3. **Position and Role of Supporting Functions:**
   - Pink volumes are interspersed around and between the blue volumes.
   - Their placement suggests they are strategically located to serve adjacent main spaces, likely providing necessary services.

4. **Overall Spatial Organization and Circulation:**
   - The layout supports efficient circulation, with corridors linking all main spaces directly.
   - Vertical connections (red) are central, ensuring easy access across different levels.
   - The arrangement suggests a balance between functional spaces and support areas, promoting logical flow and accessibility throughout.
