1. **Number and Arrangement of Main Volumes:**
   - There are five main blue volumes distributed throughout the plan.
   - These volumes are spatially distributed with two located in the left portion of the plan, two on the right, and one centrally positioned.

2. **Horizontal Connections:**
   - Gold lines connect these blue volumes, facilitating circulation.
   - Corridors link the central volume with the peripheral ones, creating a network that passes through the top and bottom of the central space.

3. **Position and Role of Supporting Functions:**
   - Pink volumes are interspersed between and adjacent to the blue volumes, providing necessary supporting functions.
   - These are strategically placed to serve the main spaces efficiently and aid in the transition between functional zones.

4. **Overall Spatial Organization and Circulation:**
   - The plan demonstrates a central circulation spine formed by horizontal connections, enhancing movement efficiency.
   - Vertical connections (red elements) are positioned at key junctures, ensuring accessibility across levels.
   - The organization promotes effective navigability and operation, with supporting functions bridging main areas.
