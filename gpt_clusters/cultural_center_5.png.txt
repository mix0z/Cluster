Sure! Hereâ€™s a description of the architectural plan:

1. **Number and Arrangement of Main Volumes**:
   - The plan features one prominent main functional space represented by a large blue volume on the right side.

2. **Horizontal Connections**:
   - Gold lines depict corridors that serve as the main horizontal routes, passing centrally through the plan.
   - These corridors link the main blue volume with other areas, facilitating movement across the structure.

3. **Position and Role of Supporting Functions**:
   - Supporting functions, shown in pink, are located on the extremities of the plan. There is a pink volume to the left and another to the right.
   - These likely house auxiliary services or spaces that support the main functional areas, placed strategically for easy access.

4. **Overall Spatial Organization and Circulation**:
   - The spatial organization is linear, with a central corridor linking horizontally positioned main and supporting spaces.
   - Vertical connections, represented by red elements, are interspersed, ensuring vertical movement within the structure. A stair or elevator on the left and another nearby on the right provide access to different floors or levels.
   - The circulation promotes efficient movement, with clear paths and strategic placement of vertical connections to complement the horizontal flow.

Overall, the plan demonstrates a straightforward and practical layout, emphasizing clear connectivity and functional zoning.
