To describe the architectural plan based on the layout:

1. **Number and Arrangement of Main Volumes:**
   - There are three main functional spaces depicted in blue.
   - These spaces are distributed with two larger volumes placed centrally and one smaller volume towards the right.
   - The arrangement suggests a balanced distribution across the center and right side of the plan.

2. **Horizontal Connections:**
   - The gold lines representing corridors or walkways are structured primarily along the perimeter and between the main volumes.
   - These connections facilitate movement between the main functional spaces, creating a fluid circulation path around and through these areas.

3. **Position and Role of Supporting Functions:**
   - Pink volumes, indicating supporting functions, are interspersed primarily along the edges of the main spaces.
   - These are positioned to provide auxiliary services without obstructing the flow between main spaces, showcasing flexibility and support to the primary functions.

4. **Overall Spatial Organization and Circulation:**
   - The arrangement suggests a flowing architecture where movement is directed along clear paths via the horizontal gold connections.
   - Red elements, indicating stairs or elevators, are strategically located near the central and peripheral areas, enabling vertical movement that complements the horizontal circulation.
   - The spatial organization is efficient, promoting interaction between main and supporting spaces while maintaining distinct circulation pathways for users.
