1. **Number and Arrangement of Main Volumes:**
   - There are five main functional spaces (blue volumes) arranged in a roughly linear sequence with varying sizes and distances between them. They are distributed throughout the central area of the plan, indicating their primary role in the layout.

2. **Horizontal Connections (Gold Lines):**
   - The horizontal connections (gold lines) form a network linking all the main volumes. There is a primary corridor running through the center, connecting all main spaces directly and allowing efficient movement along the central axis.

3. **Position and Role of Supporting Functions:**
   - Supporting functions (pink volumes) are positioned along the periphery of the main volumes, providing auxiliary spaces that likely support the activities within the main areas. They are evenly distributed along both sides, ensuring accessibility from various parts of the plan.

4. **Overall Spatial Organization and Circulation:**
   - The design emphasizes a straightforward circulation pattern with a central corridor allowing easy access between spaces. Vertical connections (red elements) are strategically placed at the edges, facilitating movement between levels. The spatial organization balances primary functions with supportive elements, ensuring logical and efficient circulation.

Overall, the plan reflects a clear hierarchy and accessibility between different functional areas, with a focus on both horizontal and vertical movement.
