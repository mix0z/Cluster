1. **Number and Arrangement of Main Volumes**:
   - The plan features one large blue volume, which represents the main functional space. It is centrally located and dominates the upper part of the layout.

2. **Horizontal Connections**:
   - The gold lines, which symbolize horizontal connections such as corridors, extend outward from the blue volume. These lines indicate pathways that facilitate movement and connectivity between different spaces.

3. **Position and Role of Supporting Functions**:
   - The pink volumes, indicating supporting functions, are positioned around the central blue volume. This arrangement suggests that they support the functionality of the main space by providing necessary auxiliary services or rooms.

4. **Overall Spatial Organization and Circulation**:
   - The layout exhibits a core-centric design, with the main space at the center, surrounded by supporting functions and connected via corridors. Circulation is organized around the central blue volume, allowing easy access to supporting functions. The red element offers vertical movement, likely connecting different floors or levels, enhancing the buildingâ€™s three-dimensional connectivity.
