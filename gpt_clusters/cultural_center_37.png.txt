1. **Number and Arrangement of Main Volumes:**
   - There are several blue volumes, indicating main functional spaces, distributed throughout the plan.
   - These volumes are primarily located in two distinct clusters: one on the left and another on the right of the diagram. This suggests a division of main functions into two primary areas.

2. **Horizontal Connections:**
   - Gold lines, representing horizontal connections, weave through the plan, connecting different spaces.
   - These corridors primarily form a network in the central area, facilitating movement between the blue main volumes and distributing circulation across the layout.

3. **Position and Role of Supporting Functions:**
   - Pink volumes, indicating supporting functions, are interspersed among the main volumes, suggesting they are integrated into the layout to support the primary activities.
   - These are mostly located along the horizontal connections and adjacent to the main volumes, highlighting their supportive role.

4. **Overall Spatial Organization and Circulation:**
   - The plan exhibits a clear zoning of functions, with main spaces divided into two clusters.
   - Circulation is straightforward, with the gold corridors providing clear paths connecting different parts of the building.
   - Red elements (stairs, elevators) are strategically placed at key interaction points, ensuring vertical circulation complements the horizontal flow efficiently.
   - The spatial organization supports a balanced flow between zones, allowing easy transition from one area to another, indicating an efficient and cohesive design.
