Based on the provided architectural plan diagram:

1. **Number and Arrangement of Main Volumes:**
   - There are two main blue volumes, each situated on different sides of the plan. They are not directly connected and appear to function as separate primary areas.

2. **Horizontal Connections:**
   - Gold lines serve as horizontal connections, or corridors, linking different spaces. One connects a blue volume to a pink volume on the left, while another connects a blue volume to nearby spaces on the right, facilitating movement between the central areas and peripheral elements.

3. **Position and Role of Supporting Functions:**
   - Pink volumes are located adjacent to or surrounding the blue volumes. On the left, a pink volume wraps around part of the blue volume, providing support functions like storage or ancillary services. On the right, a pink volume is positioned near the blue volume, likely serving similar purposes.

4. **Overall Spatial Organization and Circulation:**
   - The plan highlights a distinct separation of primary and supporting functions, with blue volumes as central functional spaces and pink volumes providing necessary support. Vertical connections in red suggest strategic points for stairs or elevators, ensuring accessibility between different levels. The gold corridors offer clear pathways for circulation, integrating primary and supporting spaces efficiently.

Overall, the spatial organization allows for effective circulation and functional zoning, with strategic connections facilitating movement and access throughout the layout.
