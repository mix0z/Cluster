Based on the architectural plan:

1. **Number and Arrangement of Main Volumes:**
   - There are five main blue volumes representing the core functional spaces. 
   - These volumes are arranged around a central point, creating an almost symmetrical layout with one large central blue space.

2. **Horizontal Connections:**
   - Gold lines serve as corridors that connect all the main blue volumes.
   - The central gold line allows a circular flow around the central blue volume, offering easy access to each space.
   - Additional gold corridors extend from the central pathway to more distant blue volumes, ensuring connectivity.

3. **Position and Role of Supporting Functions:**
   - Pink volumes, representing supporting functions, are strategically placed adjacent to the main blue volumes.
   - They are evenly distributed, ensuring that every main functional space has nearby access to supporting functions.
   - This proximity enhances efficiency and accessibility throughout the plan.

4. **Overall Spatial Organization and Circulation:**
   - The spatial organization is centralized and symmetrical with a dominant central volume.
   - Circulation is efficient, facilitated by a central corridor network that supports easy movement.
   - Vertical connections (red elements) are positioned to link different levels, ensuring vertical integration and access.
   - The layout supports a functional flow, balancing primary and auxiliary spaces efficiently.
