The architectural plan features the following topological characteristics:

1. **Number and Arrangement of Main Volumes**:
   - There are three blue volumes, indicating the main functional spaces. 
   - They are positioned in a linear arrangement, side by side.

2. **Horizontal Connections**:
   - Gold lines, representing corridors, connect these main volumes.
   - The corridors run horizontally along the top, providing access to each main space.

3. **Position and Role of Supporting Functions**:
   - There are two pink volumes integrated within the main area layout.
   - These supporting functions are located between the main spaces, suggesting a role in facilitating services or utilities adjacent to primary activities.

4. **Overall Spatial Organization and Circulation**:
   - The plan features a straightforward layout with a focus on efficient linear circulation.
   - Vertical connections (red lines) are strategically placed to ensure accessibility, enhancing movement between different levels.
   - Supporting functions positioned between main volumes suggest accessibility to necessary services without disrupting primary activities.

Overall, the design is efficient with clear delineation between main and supporting spaces, promoting ease of movement and functional organization.
