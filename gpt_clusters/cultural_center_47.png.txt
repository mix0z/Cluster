1. **Number and Arrangement of Main Volumes**:
   - There are four main blue functional spaces distributed across the plan.
   - The largest volume is positioned in the bottom left corner.
   - Two mid-sized volumes are located centrally and near the top.
   - A smaller volume is to the right.

2. **Horizontal Connections**:
   - Gold lines connect the central and right-side volumes, forming a pathway that links these spaces together.
   - The largest volume is somewhat separate but has internal corridors connecting its sections.

3. **Position and Role of Supporting Functions**:
   - Pink volumes are adjacent to main spaces, often located around their peripheries.
   - They provide additional services or amenities to the main functional areas.

4. **Overall Spatial Organization and Circulation**:
   - The plan features a combination of centralized and decentralized elements.
   - Circulation pathways primarily run through the central section, connecting most of the spaces horizontally.
   - Vertical connections (red elements) are strategically placed near or within the main spaces, providing access to different levels.
   - The layout allows for efficient movement between primary and supporting spaces, balancing accessibility and separation.
