1. **Number and Arrangement of Main Volumes:**
   - There are three blue volumes representing main functional spaces.
   - These are arranged in a linear sequence along the top, bottom, and left side of the plan.

2. **Horizontal Connections:**
   - Gold lines indicate corridors that link these main spaces.
   - A primary corridor runs along the top, connecting the right and central areas, and another horizontal corridor runs between the left and central spaces.

3. **Position and Role of Supporting Functions:**
   - Pink volumes are located on the far right and within the central area.
   - They act as buffers or transitional spaces between the main functional volumes and vertical connections.

4. **Overall Spatial Organization and Circulation:**
   - The plan features a clear linear flow with horizontal corridors facilitating movement between main spaces.
   - Vertical connections (red) are strategically placed within the central area and at the left end to connect different levels.
   - Supporting functions fill gaps in the plan, providing necessary auxiliary spaces without obstructing main circulation paths.
