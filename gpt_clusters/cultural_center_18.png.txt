Analyzing the architectural plan:

1. **Number and Arrangement of Main Volumes:**
   - There are multiple blue volumes representing the main functional spaces.
   - These volumes are irregularly arranged and dispersed throughout the plan, suggesting varied programmatic areas.

2. **Horizontal Connections:**
   - Gold lines represent corridors connecting different spaces.
   - The corridors are primarily located toward the central and right areas of the plan, linking the blue volumes effectively and facilitating movement between main functional spaces.

3. **Position and Role of Supporting Functions:**
   - Pink volumes are distributed mainly around the peripheries and near the edges of the blue volumes.
   - They are strategically positioned to support the main functional spaces, providing necessary ancillary services.

4. **Overall Spatial Organization and Circulation:**
   - The plan exhibits a dispersed organization with multiple points of interaction between main and supporting spaces.
   - Circulation is centralized mainly around the corridor network, allowing efficient access through horizontal connections.
   - Vertical circulation, marked by red elements (stairs/elevators), is integrated within and around the main volumes, ensuring easy transition between different levels or areas.
   - The spatial arrangement promotes fluidity and accessibility throughout the space.
