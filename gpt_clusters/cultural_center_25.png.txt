1. **Number and Arrangement of Main Volumes:**
   - There is one large blue volume representing the main functional space. It is located centrally in the layout, dominating the top-left part of the plan.

2. **Horizontal Connections:**
   - The gold lines serve as corridors linking different spaces. They are primarily positioned at the lower sections of the plan, creating a pathway from left to right. These corridors provide access between the main volume and other sections such as the supporting functions and vertical connections.

3. **Position and Role of Supporting Functions:**
   - The pink volumes are distributed on the left and at the bottom center, indicating their supportive role adjacent to the main volume. These might include amenities or secondary areas that support the primary functions within the blue volume.

4. **Overall Spatial Organization and Circulation:**
   - The plan features a clear spatial organization with a central main volume and peripheral supporting functions. Circulation is facilitated by the gold corridors, ensuring smooth movement horizontally across the plan. Red elements, representing vertical connections like stairs or elevators, are positioned to connect different levels, enhancing vertical circulation within the structure. Overall, the design emphasizes connectivity and accessibility across various functional zones.
