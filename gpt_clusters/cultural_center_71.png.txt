The architectural plan diagram features a clear and organized topology:

1. **Number and Arrangement of Main Volumes (Blue):**
   - There are three main functional blue volumes.
   - They are symmetrically arranged with two larger volumes on the left and right sides, and a smaller one at the top center.

2. **Horizontal Connections (Gold Lines):**
   - The gold lines serve as corridors connecting the three main volumes.
   - The central gold line runs vertically through the middle, linking all the main volumes horizontally at key points, enabling easy movement between functional spaces.

3. **Position and Role of Supporting Functions (Pink Volumes):**
   - Supporting functions are located at the top left and upper right sides of the main volumes.
   - These pink volumes likely provide auxiliary services necessary for the main spaces, contributing to overall functionality without interrupting the main circulation paths.

4. **Overall Spatial Organization and Circulation:**
   - The layout offers a balanced distribution of space, ensuring efficient circulation throughout the structure.
   - The corridor system, enhanced by the gold lines, methodically guides occupants through the main volumes with minimal obstruction.
   - Supporting functions are strategically placed to ensure accessibility without disrupting the primary spatial organization, maintaining a clear flow within the building.
