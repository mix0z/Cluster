The architectural plan presents a thoughtful spatial arrangement with distinct color-coded elements:

1. **Number and Arrangement of Main Volumes:**
   - Seven blue volumes are distributed throughout the plan.
   - These main functional spaces are predominantly located on the right side, forming a coherent block with extensions to the north and southeast.

2. **Horizontal Connections:**
   - Gold lines illustrate corridors that link various spaces.
   - These connections run primarily perpendicular and parallel, creating a grid-like structure that ensures accessibility to all main spaces.

3. **Position and Role of Supporting Functions:**
   - Pink volumes represent the supporting functions.
   - Positioned throughout, they seem to be interspersed between the main volumes, offering adjacency and supporting the functions in the main spaces.

4. **Overall Spatial Organization and Circulation:**
   - The plan shows a balanced layout, with horizontal connections facilitating smooth movement across spaces.
   - Red elements (vertical connections) are strategically placed at intervals, likely serving access to different floors and enhancing circulation vertically.
   - The integration of main and supporting functions suggests a design focused on functionality and ease of access, both vertically and horizontally.
