1. **Number and Arrangement of Main Volumes:**
   - There are three blue volumes representing the main functional spaces. These volumes are rectangular and are positioned separately from each other across the plan.

2. **Horizontal Connections:**
   - Gold lines, which symbolize horizontal connections like corridors, are present within each blue volume. They serve to connect different sections within the main volumes.

3. **Position and Role of Supporting Functions:**
   - Pink volumes, indicating supporting functions, are located adjacent to the gold lines within the blue volumes. They are interspersed between gold lines, likely to provide easy access to supporting services.

4. **Overall Spatial Organization and Circulation:**
   - The spatial organization is divided into three separate main volumes, each self-contained with its own circulation path. The gold horizontal connections efficiently link different sections within the same volume, facilitating movement. Red elements, which act as vertical connections, are placed at ends or centrally within the blue volumes to offer vertical access. The supporting pink functions are strategically located to provide necessary services without obstructing flow, ensuring smooth circulation throughout each volume.
