1. **Number and Arrangement of Main Volumes:**
   - The plan includes two primary blue volumes, which represent the main functional spaces. These are sizable and centrally located within the layout, each occupying a substantial portion in their respective sectors.

2. **Horizontal Connections:**
   - Gold lines signify corridors connecting different spaces. They are strategically positioned to link the main blue volumes with surrounding areas, promoting smooth circulation throughout each sector of the building. These connections appear to ensure easy access between the primary spaces and other functional areas.

3. **Position and Role of Supporting Functions:**
   - Pink volumes, representing supporting functions, are distributed around the main volumes and near the edges of the layout. Their placement suggests they serve auxiliary roles, likely supporting the primary activities occurring in the main volumes by offering essential services or utilities.

4. **Overall Spatial Organization and Circulation:**
   - The spatial organization is divided into distinct sectors. Each sector integrates a main functional space with accompanying supporting functions and connections. Vertical connections (red elements) are strategically placed, potentially indicating access points like staircases or elevators, critical for multi-level movement. The layout demonstrates a clear hierarchy and efficient circulation pattern, emphasizing functional space connectivity and accessibility.
