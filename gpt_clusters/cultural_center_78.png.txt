Here's a description based on the architectural plan:

1. **Number and Arrangement of Main Volumes**:
   - There are three main blue volumes present.
   - They are arranged linearly along a diagonal axis, occupying a triangular plan.
   - The configuration allows each main space to be adjacent to others, promoting functional adjacency.

2. **Horizontal Connections**:
   - The gold lines, representing corridors, run through the center of the plan.
   - These corridors link all main functional spaces linearly, ensuring easy circulation between them.
   - The central placement of the corridors maximizes accessibility to each space.

3. **Position and Role of Supporting Functions**:
   - The pink volumes are strategically placed throughout the plan.
   - They are located at both ends and between the main volumes, serving as buffers and support zones.
   - These supporting functions are likely intended to provide additional facilities necessary for the main spaces.

4. **Overall Spatial Organization and Circulation**:
   - The layout is efficient, with a clear axis of movement provided by the central corridor.
   - The mix of pink and blue volumes ensures that supporting functions are readily accessible from main spaces.
   - The design emphasizes straightforward circulation through the horizontal corridors, with vertical connections (red elements) dispersed for easy access between different levels.

Overall, the plan is organized to balance functional requirements with efficient circulation, enhancing interaction and accessibility between various spaces.
