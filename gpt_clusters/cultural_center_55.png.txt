Based on the architectural plan diagram:

1. **Number and Arrangement of Main Volumes:**
   - There are two main blue volumes. 
   - These volumes are positioned on opposite sides of the central circular space, providing balance and symmetry in the layout. 

2. **Horizontal Connections:**
   - Gold lines indicate the corridors linking different spaces.
   - The horizontal connections mainly radiate from the central circular space, acting as the core hub for movement across the building.
   - They efficiently connect the main functional spaces with each other and with the supporting functions.

3. **Position and Role of Supporting Functions:**
   - Pink volumes are scattered throughout the plan, predominantly along the periphery.
   - These supporting functions are strategically placed to provide necessary services and support without interrupting the main circulation paths.
   - They are accessible via the horizontal corridors, ensuring easy access from any main space.

4. **Overall Spatial Organization and Circulation:**
   - The layout is centered around a large circular area, which seems to serve as a pivotal circulation point.
   - The design employs a radial pattern for movement facilitation, optimizing connectivity between the different types of spaces.
   - Vertical connections (red elements like stairs and elevators) are placed at strategic intervals, typically near the extremities of the corridors, enabling seamless vertical movement within the building.
   - The spatial organization promotes efficient workflow and ease of navigation, with distinct zones for main activities and supporting functions.
