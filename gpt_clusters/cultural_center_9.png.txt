Based on the architectural plan described:

1. **Number and Arrangement of Main Volumes:**
   - There are four main blue volumes located primarily along the bottom and the right side of the diagram. These are organized linearly along corridors, with two larger spaces on the bottom and two smaller spaces on the right-hand side.

2. **Horizontal Connections:**
   - The gold lines representing horizontal connections form an L-shaped corridor. The bottom horizontal corridor connects the main volumes along its path, while the vertical corridor runs upward on the right side, linking the smaller spaces.

3. **Position and Role of Supporting Functions:**
   - Pink volumes are situated adjacent to the blue volumes. They are interspersed along the horizontal and vertical paths, serving to support the main functional spaces by providing necessary auxiliary functionalities.

4. **Overall Spatial Organization and Circulation:**
   - The overall layout shows efficient use of space, with corridors facilitating clear movement throughout the building. The layout prioritizes linear circulation, with the main and supporting functions positioned to optimize accessibility. Vertical connections in red, such as stairs or elevators, are strategically placed near the junction of corridors and at the end of the horizontal path to enhance vertical movement within the structure.
