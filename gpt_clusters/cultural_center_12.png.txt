1. **Number and Arrangement of Main Volumes:**
   - There are several blue volumes representing the main functional spaces, distributed across the plan.
   - These volumes are arranged predominantly in an L-shape, facilitating spatial zoning and functional separation.

2. **Horizontal Connections:**
   - The gold lines illustrate horizontal connections, primarily corridors.
   - These connections run through the center of the plan, linking the main spaces efficiently and providing access to different areas.
   - The corridors ensure seamless flow between different functional spaces, supporting easy movement.

3. **Position and Role of Supporting Functions:**
   - The pink volumes are strategically placed adjacent to the main functional spaces.
   - This proximity suggests their role in providing ancillary services to the primary functions.
   - They appear in smaller clusters near key intersections of main spaces and corridors, enhancing utility.

4. **Overall Spatial Organization and Circulation:**
   - The spatial organization is clear and logical, with distinct zones for main and supporting functions.
   - Circulation is facilitated by central corridors and strategically placed vertical connections.
   - Red elements, indicating stairs or elevators, are distributed at key locations, ensuring vertical accessibility.
   - The layout supports both efficient movement and effective interaction between different spatial components.
