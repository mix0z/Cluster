To describe the architectural plan based on the diagram:

1. **Number and Arrangement of Main Volumes**:
   - There are six main blue volumes, functioning as the primary spaces.
   - They are arranged in two distinct clusters: a larger cluster on the right and a smaller cluster on the left, forming an L-shape.

2. **Horizontal Connections (Gold Lines)**:
   - A single, long gold line serves as the main corridor, linking the two clusters.
   - It horizontally connects the upper sections of both clusters, facilitating movement across the main spaces.

3. **Position and Role of Supporting Functions (Pink Volumes)**:
   - Pink volumes are primarily situated at strategic points: between the blue volumes and at intersections with the corridor.
   - They are dispersed through the clusters, acting as buffers or transitional spaces between main functional areas.

4. **Overall Spatial Organization and Circulation**:
   - The spatial organization fosters two distinct zones (left and right), connected by a central corridor.
   - Circulation is linear, with the main corridor providing a backbone for movement.
   - Supporting functions ensure seamless transitions between main spaces, aiding functionality and flow.

This topology allows for efficient navigation while maintaining clear separations between main and supporting spaces.
