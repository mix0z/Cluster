Certainly! Here's a description of the architectural plan based on the given diagram:

1. **Number and Arrangement of Main Volumes:**
   - There are four main blue volumes in the plan.
   - These volumes are distributed with two positioned toward the top-right, one at the center-left, and one at the bottom right.

2. **Horizontal Connections:**
   - Gold lines act as horizontal corridors connecting different spaces.
   - A prominent corridor runs centrally, linking the central-left main volume to the central connecting point, and extends to the bottom and right, providing access to the bottom-right main volume.

3. **Position and Role of Supporting Functions:**
   - Pink volumes, representing supporting functions, are situated centrally in the plan.
   - Their position allows them to be easily accessed from all main volumes, implying a supportive role for adjacent spaces.

4. **Overall Spatial Organization and Circulation:**
   - The plan features a central axis formed by the gold corridors, facilitating movement horizontally and vertically.
   - Vertical circulation (red elements) is positioned centrally, emphasizing efficient movement between levels.
   - The spatial organization provides clear, direct routes between main functional spaces, supported by conveniently located auxiliary functions.

Overall, the design promotes efficient circulation and accessibility across the functional areas, with well-integrated supporting functions.
