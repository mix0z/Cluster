1. **Number and Arrangement of Main Volumes**:
   - The plan features several blue volumes representing the main functional spaces. These are distributed across different areas of the plan, located primarily towards the exterior boundaries, suggesting usage of perimeter spaces for key functions.

2. **Horizontal Connections**:
   - The gold lines, indicating horizontal connections, weave through the plan, effectively linking the main blue volumes. The corridors facilitate access between these spaces, running parallel to some edges and occasionally bisecting the plan, which allows for smooth circulation throughout the structure and connects major areas efficiently.

3. **Position and Role of Supporting Functions**:
   - Pink volumes, representing supporting functions, are interspersed among the main blue volumes. These are strategically placed to offer auxiliary support, typically in proximity to the primary spaces they assist, ensuring functional integration. Their distribution also helps in maintaining a balance between main and secondary tasks within the spatial layout.

4. **Overall Spatial Organization and Circulation**:
   - The overall spatial organization is both coherent and accessible, with a logical flow facilitated by the central and peripheral corridors. The layout promotes clear and efficient circulation, with the vertical red elements (stairs, elevators) positioned strategically to facilitate vertical movement and ease access across different levels. This integration of horizontal and vertical connections emphasizes functional efficiency, allowing for seamless interaction among various parts of the plan.
