Based on the architectural plan diagram:

1. **Number and Arrangement of Main Volumes:**
   - There are several blue volumes, which represent the main functional spaces. They are spread across the layout primarily on the left and right portions.
   - These spaces are arranged in a linear fashion along an angled axis, creating a clear directionality in the plan.

2. **Horizontal Connections:**
   - Gold lines represent the horizontal connections, such as corridors. These lines link the main functional spaces and seem to run predominantly along the central axis of the plan.
   - The connections create a fluid movement path, allowing easy access between different blue volumes and guiding circulation through the space.

3. **Position and Role of Supporting Functions:**
   - Pink volumes, indicating supporting functions, are interspersed among the main spaces, strategically placed to serve different areas.
   - These are located at junctions or near main spaces, ensuring that support facilities are conveniently accessible.

4. **Overall Spatial Organization and Circulation:**
   - The spatial organization is linear and angled, focusing on efficient circulation with a primary pathway along the central axis.
   - The placement of red elements (vertical connections) at strategic points facilitates vertical movement and connectivity between different floors or levels.
   - The combination of blue, pink, and gold elements creates a cohesive space with smooth movement and access to both main and supporting functions.
