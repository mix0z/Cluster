1. **Number and Arrangement of Main Volumes**:
   - There are two main blue volumes. 
   - These are positioned diagonally across the plan, creating a dynamic spatial arrangement.

2. **Horizontal Connections**:
   - The gold lines connect the two blue volumes horizontally.
   - These corridors provide movement routes between the main spaces, ensuring efficient circulation.

3. **Position and Role of Supporting Functions**:
   - Pink volumes are located adjacent to the blue spaces.
   - They serve as supplementary areas, possibly for utilities or services linked to the main functions.

4. **Overall Spatial Organization and Circulation**:
   - The plan has a diagonal layout, with clear horizontal pathways.
   - Vertical connections in red are strategically placed to allow movement between different levels.
   - This creates a cohesive flow through the spaces, combining main and supporting functions efficiently.
