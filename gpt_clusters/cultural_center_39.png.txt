Based on the architectural plan diagram:

1. **Number and Arrangement of Main Volumes:**
   - There are three main blue volumes located centrally and toward the right side of the plan.
   - These volumes are distributed with one larger central space and two smaller spaces adjacent or nearby.

2. **Horizontal Connections:**
   - Gold lines indicate the corridors, linking the main functional spaces.
   - The largest horizontal connection runs horizontally across the middle of the diagram, connecting various spaces and supporting functions.

3. **Position and Role of Supporting Functions:**
   - Pink volumes are distributed around the main blue spaces.
   - These are positioned adjacent to or between main volumes, possibly serving as utility areas, restrooms, or offices.

4. **Overall Spatial Organization and Circulation:**
   - The circulation system is largely centralized with gold lines facilitating movement through the central corridors.
   - Vertical connections (red elements) such as stairs or elevators are strategically placed at different points for vertical circulation, often near main and supporting functions.
   - The layout suggests easy accessibility and navigation through these interconnected spaces, focusing on a central hub with peripheral supporting functions.
