Based on the architectural plan diagram:

1. **Number and Arrangement of Main Volumes**: 
   - There are two main blue volumes. 
   - They are positioned linearly, one following the other, indicating a sequential organization likely serving different primary functions.

2. **Horizontal Connections**:
   - Gold lines run horizontally connecting the blue volumes.
   - This suggests corridors or pathways enabling easy movement between these main functional spaces.

3. **Position and Role of Supporting Functions**:
   - Pink volumes are positioned at the periphery of the main blue volumes.
   - These could serve as auxiliary functions such as storage rooms, bathrooms, or service areas, supporting the main activities within the blue volumes.

4. **Overall Spatial Organization and Circulation**:
   - The layout exhibits a clear linear organization.
   - The arrangement facilitates straightforward circulation, with corridors (gold lines) connecting all main and supporting spaces.
   - Vertical connections (red elements) are strategically placed to enable vertical movement, likely at intersections or endpoints of horizontal paths, ensuring accessibility across levels.

This setup promotes efficient flow and easy accessibility throughout the structure.
