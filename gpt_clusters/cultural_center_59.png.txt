Based on the architectural plan provided:

1. **Number and Arrangement of Main Volumes:**
   - There are several blue volumes representing the main functional spaces. They are distributed across two primary areas in the plan, appearing to anchor key zones within the layout. The volumes have varied shapes and sizes, indicating different types of main spaces.

2. **Horizontal Connections:**
   - Gold lines link the different spaces horizontally, serving as corridors. These connections create pathways between the main functional spaces, facilitating movement across the layout. The corridors loop and extend across the plan, interconnecting the areas efficiently.

3. **Position and Role of Supporting Functions:**
   - Pink volumes are dispersed throughout the diagram, situated near the blue main spaces. These support functions are likely essential services or auxiliary spaces, strategically placed to be accessible from the main areas they support.

4. **Overall Spatial Organization and Circulation:**
   - The spatial organization is fluid, with a continuous loop of circulation created by the corridors. The positioning of vertical connections like stairs and elevators (red elements) suggests vertical circulation is centralized, making it easy to move between levels. The plan aims for a cohesive flow, with main and supporting spaces integrated for effective operation.
