Based on the architectural plan:

1. **Number and Arrangement of Main Volumes:**
   - There are three main blue volumes. 
   - They are arranged with two volumes positioned on the top and one on the bottom left.

2. **Horizontal Connections:**
   - Gold lines form corridors that connect the main volumes.
   - These corridors create a central path looping around and linking all spaces together, allowing easy movement throughout the space.

3. **Position and Role of Supporting Functions:**
   - The pink volumes appear to be strategically placed at junctions, indicating their role as ancillary spaces that support the primary functions.
   - They are positioned near the main corridors, likely for accessibility.

4. **Overall Spatial Organization and Circulation:**
   - The layout is compact with clear division between main and supporting functions.
   - Circulation is well-organized, allowing movement primarily along the central corridors.
   - Vertical connections, marked in red, are placed near the central area to facilitate movement between floors efficiently.
