1. **Number and Arrangement of Main Volumes**:
   - There are three main blue volumes representing the primary functional spaces.
   - These volumes are distributed across different sections of the plan, with one located in the triangular section towards the bottom and two others placed within a larger configuration at the top.

2. **Horizontal Connections**:
   - The gold lines serve as corridors linking different spaces.
   - They connect the main blue volumes with each other and with other parts of the plan. The connectivity appears to create a smooth circulation path between areas.

3. **Position and Role of Supporting Functions**:
   - Pink volumes are embedded within or adjacent to the main blue volumes, indicating their supportive role.
   - They provide supplementary functions to the main spaces, possibly offering amenities or auxiliary services.

4. **Overall Spatial Organization and Circulation**:
   - The plan has a coherent spatial organization, with clearly defined paths for circulation marked by the gold lines.
   - Vertical connections, shown in red, provide access to different levels, ensuring smooth movement between floors.
   - The combination of blue, pink, gold, and red elements creates an integrated system that accommodates primary uses, supportive activities, and efficient movement throughout the structure.
