Based on the architectural plan provided:

1. **Number and Arrangement of Main Volumes:**
   - There are three main functional spaces, represented by blue volumes.
   - The blue volumes are arranged linearly from left to right across the plan.

2. **Horizontal Connections:**
   - The gold lines indicate horizontal connections, forming corridors that link the different blue volumes.
   - These corridors run parallel to the main spaces, facilitating movement from one end of the layout to the other.

3. **Position and Role of Supporting Functions:**
   - Pink volumes denote supporting functions and are interspersed among the blue volumes.
   - They are located adjacent to or within the main functional spaces, providing necessary supplementary services.

4. **Overall Spatial Organization and Circulation:**
   - The spatial organization is linear and clearly delineated, with the gold corridors ensuring efficient flow between spaces.
   - Red elements, representing vertical connections, are strategically placed at intervals to allow vertical movement, possibly connecting multiple floors.
   - The design promotes straightforward circulation, with clear pathways and accessible supporting functions integrated throughout.
