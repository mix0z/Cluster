### 1. Number and Arrangement of Main Volumes:
- There are four main functional spaces, depicted in blue.
- They are arranged in a non-linear formation, creating a variety of spatial configurations.
- The main volumes are positioned relatively distributed throughout the plan, creating separate zones.

### 2. Horizontal Connections:
- The gold lines represent corridors or similar horizontal circulation paths.
- These connections facilitate movement across different spaces, linking the main volumes.
- The gold lines create a network that allows for fluid navigation throughout the entire plan, integrating various areas efficiently.

### 3. Position and Role of Supporting Functions:
- Supporting functions, shown in pink, are interspersed among the main volumes.
- They are strategically positioned to support the primary functions and improve access.
- These areas possibly serve as storage, service rooms, or secondary spaces, contributing to operational efficiency.

### 4. Overall Spatial Organization and Circulation:
- The plan appears to be organized with an emphasis on connectivity and accessibility, with main and supporting spaces clearly defined.
- Vertical connections (red elements) are centrally located, ensuring easy access between different levels.
- The overall layout promotes smooth circulation, with key functional areas connected through well-placed corridors, creating a cohesive spatial experience.
