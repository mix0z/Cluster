1. **Number and Arrangement of Main Volumes:**
   - There are three primary blue volumes. 
   - One large, irregularly shaped volume on the left dominates the plan.
   - The other two are smaller and located towards the right, stacked linearly along the horizontal axis.

2. **Horizontal Connections:**
   - Gold lines extend through the plan, linking all main spaces.
   - Main corridors allow circulation from the large volume on the left to the smaller volumes on the right.
   - These corridors also intersect with red vertical connections, ensuring accessibility to different levels.

3. **Position and Role of Supporting Functions:**
   - Pink volumes, representing supporting functions, are interspersed primarily around the central areas.
   - They bridge between the main functional spaces, likely serving as transitional zones or ancillary facilities.

4. **Overall Spatial Organization and Circulation:**
   - The plan features a linear progression from left to right, with main functional spaces connected by a continuous corridor.
   - Vertical connections (red) are strategically placed for easy access to different floors.
   - Supporting functions are centrally positioned to facilitate subsidiary activities and connect primary spaces seamlessly.
   - Overall, the design emphasizes fluid movement and accessibility throughout the building.
