1. **Number and Arrangement of Main Volumes**:
   - There are multiple main volumes, each in blue, dispersed in an organic pattern, suggesting a free-flowing arrangement. These volumes likely serve as the primary functional areas.

2. **Horizontal Connections**:
   - The gold lines indicate the corridors or passageways. These lines link the central cluster of main volumes, providing circulation pathways that connect different functional areas horizontally.

3. **Position and Role of Supporting Functions**:
   - The pink volumes are situated adjacent to the main blue volumes, serving as auxiliary spaces that support the primary functions. Their proximity to the main areas suggests accessibility and integration.

4. **Overall Spatial Organization and Circulation**:
   - The plan suggests a central hub of activity with supporting functions closely connected. The spatial organization is radial, with main and supporting functions radiating outward. Circulation is facilitated by the strategic placement of horizontal and vertical connectors, promoting efficient movement throughout the space.
