1. **Number and Arrangement of Main Volumes:**
   - There are four main blue volumes distributed throughout the plan.
   - They are positioned both centrally and towards the edges, creating distinct functional areas.

2. **Horizontal Connections:**
   - Gold lines indicate corridors linking these main volumes.
   - These connections create pathways around and between the main spaces, ensuring accessibility throughout the layout.

3. **Position and Role of Supporting Functions:**
   - Pink volumes are interspersed between the blue volumes.
   - They are strategically placed to complement the main spaces, providing necessary auxiliary functions close to the primary areas.

4. **Overall Spatial Organization and Circulation:**
   - The layout shows a clear organization with main volumes connected through centrally located horizontal corridors.
   - Red elements (vertical connections) are distributed mainly near or within the main volumes, promoting efficient vertical movement.
   - The plan ensures a logical flow with well-placed supporting functions aiding the main spaces, while allowing for intuitive navigation and circulation through both horizontal and vertical routes.
